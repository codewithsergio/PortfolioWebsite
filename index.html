          I am currently the President of the FAANG Coding club, which I created
          for my university. In the meetings, I lecture to students about Java
          syntax and how to solve algorithm problems. I also am open to allowing
          students to ask me coding related questions outside of meetings as
          well, and I try to get back to them as quick as possible.

          A website where Javascript code figures out the standard deviation of
          a set of numbers that you supply it. The site also gives you a
          description of the steps to do it yourself as well, and gives you the
          mean and median of your set of numbers.
